------------------------------------------------

Codestriker is a perl CGI script which is used for performing code
reviews in a collaborative fashion as opposed to using unstructured
emails.

Authors create code review topics, where the nominated reviewers will
be automatically notified by email.  Reviewers then submit comments
against the code on a per-line basis, and can also view comments
submitted by the other reviewers as they are created.  Emails are sent
to the appropriate parties when comments are created, as an alert
mechanism.  The author is also free to submit comments against the
review comments.

Once all reviewers have finished, the author has all
review comments available in a structured fashion, as
opposed to a pile of unstructured emails.

Special support is provided for integration with a CVS
repository, for the display of coloured diffs and for the
ability to view original and new files in their entirety
to assist in the review process.  Codestriker can be
optionally linked with a bug tracking system, such as
bugzilla, and a CVS web viewing system, such as CVS web to
obtain further information necessary to complete a review.

Installation
------------

Please read the CHANGELOG file for functionality changes between
releases.

I use codestriker as a tool behind our company's firewall for
performing code reviews within our engineering team.  For RedHat 7.1,
the installation is simply the following as root on the internal web
server (for simple CGI script use not using mod_perl):

	    cd /var/www/cgi-bin
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.pl .
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.css ../html
	    mkdir /var/www/codestriker
	    chown apache.apache /var/www/codestriker
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.conf /var/www/codestriker

The CSS file can be located elsewhere of course, but if it is stored
in another location, be sure to update its location in codestriker.pl.

To use Codestriker with mod_perl, which reduces the startup costs of
creating a new Perl interpreter and parsing the Codestriker script for
each request, I do the following:

	    mkdir /var/www/codestriker
	    chown apache.apache /var/www/codestriker
	    cd /var/www/codestriker
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.css ../html
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.pl .
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.conf .

Put the following lines in your httpd.conf file (probably located in
/etc/httpd/conf), so that the
http://yoursite.yourdomain/codestriker/codestriker.pl is the URL to
codestriker.

Alias /codestriker/  /var/www/codestriker/

<Location /codestriker>
 SetHandler  perl-script
 PerlHandler Apache::Registry
 Options +ExecCGI
</Location>

PerlTaintCheck On

Most distributions of Linux seem to configure apache with mod_perl, so
the above approach is recommended.  Restart apache with something like
"/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart" and you should be away.

Compression support
-------------------

The pages generated from Codestriker can be quite large, depending on
the size of the review and the files involved.  It can send the HTML
as content-encoding x-gzip.  Browsers such as Netscape, Konqueror and
Mozilla supporting the handling of compressed data.  Unfortunately, IE
can't.  Using compression can make an enormous difference in the speed
of transfers, particularly over slow links.  If you have installed
Codestriker with mod_perl, and wish to use compression, you must also
install the Compress::Zlib module, available from CPAN
(http://www.cpan.org).  For non mod_perl installs, the gzip executable
can be used for compression.  When receiving a page from Codestriker,
the page source contains near the top within an HTML comment whether
the text was sent compressed or not.

Data storage
------------

Codestriker stores all of its topic data and comments by default in
"/var/www/codestriker".  This location can be changed by the
configuration variable at the start of the script.  This directory
needs to be owned by the user which runs httpd, since the script
creates files and directories under the "/var/www/codestriker"
directory.  The username is typically either nobody or apache.  Use
the "ps auxww | grep httpd" command to find out.

Codestriker settings
--------------------

Read through the configuration options within codestriker.pl and
codestriker.conf to ensure all the settings are correct for your site.
It is intended that codestriker.conf will remain fairly static, so
upgrades should be fairly painless.  Among other things, the settings
include the location of your CVS repository, the base URL to your bug
tracking system, and the base URL to your CVS viewing system.  Note
these settings can be left blank, they aren't required in order to use
Codestriker.

For deployments outside an intranet, I would suggest using apache's
".htaccess" mechanism to limit access as to who can execute the
script, as an extra security precaution.
