--------------------------

Codestriker is a perl CGI script which is used for performing code
reviews in a collaborative fashion as opposed to using unstructured
emails.

Authors create code review topics, where the nominated reviewers will
be automatically notified by email.  Reviewers then submit comments
against the code on a per-line basis, and can also view comments
submitted by the other reviewers as they are created.  Emails are sent
to the appropriate parties when comments are created, as an alert
mechanism.  The author is also free to submit comments against the
review comments.

Once all reviewers have finished, the author has all
review comments available in a structured fashion, as
opposed to a pile of unstructured emails.

Special support is provided for integration with a CVS
repository, for the display of coloured diffs and for the
ability to view original and new files in their entirety
to assist in the review process.  Codestriker can be
optionally linked with a bug tracking system, such as
bugzilla, and a CVS web viewing system, such as CVS web to
obtain further information necessary to complete a review.

Installation
------------

I use codestriker as a tool behind our company's firewall for
performing code reviews within our engineering team.  For RedHat 7.1,
the installation is simply the following as root on the internal web
server:

	    cd /var/www/cgi-bin
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.pl .
	    cp /from/installed/location/codestriker.css ../html
	    mkdir /var/www/codestriker
	    chown apache.apache /var/www/codestriker

The CSS file can be located elsewhere of course, but if it is stored
in another location, be sure to update its location in codestriker.pl.

Codestriker stores all of its topic data and comments by default in
"/var/www/codestriker".  This location can be changed by the
configuration variable at the start of the script.  This directory
needs to be owned by the user which runs httpd, since the script
creates files and directories under the "/var/www/codestriker"
directory.  The username is typically either nobody or apache.  Use
the "ps auxww | grep httpd" command to find out.

Read through the configuration options within codestriker.pl to ensure
all the settings are correct for your site.

For deployments outside an intranet, I would suggest using apache's
".htaccess" mechanism to limit access as to who can execute the
script, as an extra security precaution.

Future plans
------------

Obviously there are many enhancements that can be made to this tool.
My initial goal was to build something quickly and it get it out there
for real use, which will then hopefully provide further input to
future enhancements.
