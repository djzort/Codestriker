# that this metric can be assigned to.  The "default_value" attribute
# is optional, and indicates what the default value of the metric is
# assigned to.  If this attribute is not specified, then the user will
# be required to specify a value for a metric when creating a new
# comment thread.  This is recommended, so that users think about what
# these values should be, rather than blindly accepting default
# values.  For the "Status" metric below however, it is recording the
# "state" of the thread, so an initial state of "Submitted" is reasonable.
# For the other metrics below, an initial value makes no sense.

# This options configures the metric support in codestriker. You have
# the following options:
#
# $metric_config = "none", "basic", "all", "metric name, metric name, etc"
#
# "none" - turns off all extra metric support in the application. The
# metric page will only display and manage data that is strictly
# required to perform the review.  Codestriker will not require any
# addition data input from the reviewers and authors.  This is the
# default. However, you still get basic data like how many topics are
# being created and how problems are being found.
#
# "basic" - Turns on the metrics that are considered to be essential
# for a metric program. It will require that reviewers and authors
# enter the time spent reviewing the topic, the time spent in the
# review meeting, and the time spent preparing for the review. The
# metric selection assumes that you are following a formal review
# process with a preparation meeting, and a defect review meeting.
#   
#   kickoff time - time spent preparing for the review
#   checking time - time spent actually reviewing the topic.
#   logging meeting duration - the time spent in the logging meeting.
#
# "all" - Turns on all of the metrics that one could possibly want to
# track. The list of metrics is from the book "Software Inspection" by
# Gilb and Graham.  You should probably not use this unless you are
# using a formal process that is well established. You may want to
# enable this temporally to get a idea of the types of metrics that
# are supported.
#
# "name,name" - Lastly, you can pick and chose what metrics you would
# like to enable.  just list the metric names in a comma separated
# list. You can see all of the build in metrics in the
# lib/Codestriker.pm file. For example, if you don't hold a kick off
# meeting, and but do hold a logging meeting, the basic option will not
# quit fit. You should set the $metric_config as:
# $metric_config = "checking time,logging meeting duration".
#
# If you don't like our choices of metrics, the names, descriptions,
# etc feel free to edit the lib/Codestriker.pm. It contains
# documentations on how to add your own metrics into codestriker. It
# is easy to do, and does not require any coding.
