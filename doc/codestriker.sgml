      <title>What is Codestriker?</title>
      <para>
        Codestriker is a web application which facilitates
        collaborative code reviewing.  Authors create code review
        topics, where the nominated reviewers will be automatically
        notified by email.  Reviewers then submit comments against the
        code on a per-line basis, and can also view comments submitted
        by the other reviewers as they are created.  Emails are sent
        to the appropriate parties when comments are created, as an
        alert mechanism.  The author is also free to submit comments
        against the review comments.  Once all reviewers have
        finished, the author has all review comments available in a
        structured fashion.  All information is stored in a relational
        database, which Codestriker can search over.
      </para>
      <para>
        Special support is provided for integration with
	<ulink url="http://cvshome.org">CVS</ulink> and
	<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</ulink>
	 source control management systems, for the display
	of coloured diffs and for the ability to view original and new
	files in their entirety to assist in the review process.
	Codestriker can be optionally linked with a bug tracking
	system, such as Bugzilla.  Other SCM systems, such as
	ClearCase and VSS will be added in future releases, given help
	from the developer community.  Codestriker can also be linked
	with
	<ulink url="http://lxr.sourceforge.net">LXR</ulink> to allow
	for fast lookup of code entities, to assist in the review
	process.
      </para>
      <para>
        Codestriker is written in Perl in a cross-platform style.  It
        can run on any variant of *NIX (Linux, *BSD) and has been
        tested and installed on Window systems (Windows 98 and above).

  <chapter>
    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>
      This chapter is concerned with installing Codestriker on your
      system.  This requires the following steps:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>creating the Codestriker database;</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>configuring the webserver; and</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>             
    </para>

    <sect1 id="codestriker-database-creation">
      <title>Codestriker database creation</title>
      <para>
        Codestriker stores all code review topics and comments into a
        relational database.  Currently,
	<ulink url="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</ulink> and
	<ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</ulink> are
        supported, but any database system can be used provided it has
        an implementation of Perl's DBI interface.
      </para>
      <sect2>
        <title>Using MySQL</title>
	<para>
	  MySQL can be used on either *NIX or Window platforms.  It is
	  available for download from
	  <ulink
	  url="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</ulink>.
	  For Linux RedHat distributions, the necessary packages
	  required are mysql mysql-devel, mysql-server, which may or
	  may not already be present on your system.  Depending on
	  your *NIX distribution, starting mysql will be something
	  like the following:
	  <programlisting>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql start
          </programlisting>
	  For Windows, there will typically be a desktop icon or menu
	  shortcut for starting mysqld.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Once mysql is running, it is necessary to create the
	  codestriker database and create the codestriker user.  Under
	  *NIX, a command like the following will be required:
	  <programlisting>
% mysql -u root mysql
          </programlisting>
          For Windows, there should be a shortcut available for
          getting a mysql prompt.
	</para>
	<para>
	  At the mysql prompt, issue the following command, but
	  substitute a suitable database password instead of cspasswd
	  as shown here.
	  <programlisting>
CREATE DATABASE codestrikerdb;

GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,INDEX,ALTER,CREATE,DROP,REFERENCES
 ON codestrikerdb.* TO codestriker@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'cspasswd';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

QUIT
          </programlisting>
	 </para>
	 <para>
	   You can check the Codestriker database at any time from the
	   command line, by issuing the following command, and
	   entering the database password:
	  <programlisting>
mysql -u codestriker -D codestrikerdb -p
          </programlisting>
	 </para>
	 <para>
	   If required, the Codestriker database can be dropped, by
	   entering in the following command at the mysql command
	   prompt as user root:
	  <programlisting>
DROP DATABASE codestrikerdb;
          </programlisting>
	 </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Using PostgreSQL</title>
	<para>
	  At the time of writing PostgreSQL was only available for
	  *NIX platforms, however it is quite possible by the time you
	  are reading this that a version for Windows is available.
	  The project page for PostgreSQL is:
	  <ulink
	  url="http://www.postgresql.org">http://www.postgresql.org</ulink>.
	  For Linux RedHat distributions, the postgresql,
	  postgresql-server and postgresql-devel packages are
	  required.  Make sure you are using at least version 7.1, as
	  prior versions had restrictions on the size of "text"
	  fields, making it impractical for use with Codestriker.
	  PostgreSQL can be started with a command like:
	  <programlisting>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql start
          </programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  To create the Codestriker database and user, enter the
	  following commands:
	  <programlisting>
% createuser --username=postgres -d -A codestriker
% createdb --username=codestriker codestrikerdb
          </programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Make sure your <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file is
	  suitable configured, in particular for authentication.
	  This file is often located in
	  <filename>/etc/postgres</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  You can check the Codestriker database interactively at any
	  time with the following command:
	  <programlisting>
% psql -U codestriker codestrikerdb
          </programlisting>
	</para>
	 <para>
	   If required, the Codestriker database can be dropped, by
	   entering in the following command:
	  <programlisting>
% dropdb --username=codestriker codestrikerdb
          </programlisting>
	 </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Other Databases</title>
	<para>
	  Codestriker is written using the Perl DBI package, which
	  makes it portable for use between different databases.
	  Apart from the specifics of creating the database and
	  starting it, Codestriker should work without change for
	  other databases.
	</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>
        This section is concerned with unpacking the Codestriker
        distribution into a suitable location, and then configuring
        it.  For *NIX distribution, the following commands may be
        appropriate on your system:
	<programlisting>
% mkdir /var/www/codestriker
% cd /var/www/codestriker
% tar zxvf /from/installed/location/codestriker-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
% chown -R apache.apache /var/www/codestriker/codestriker-X.Y.Z
	</programlisting>
	Here "apache" is the user which runs the Apache server.  It
	could be "nobody" under different systems.  Check with the
	<command>ps auxww</command> command, or check your Apache
	configuration files.  Under Windows, the Codestriker
	distribution could be unzipped into a suitable location under
	<filename>c:\program files</filename>, or just
	<filename>c:\codestriker</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The next task is to edit the
        <filename>codestriker.conf</filename> configuration file to
        reflect the settings on your site.  The file is documented
        with examples to assist in setting appropriate values.  The
        file is in Perl syntax, so lines starting with a '#' indicate
        a comment.
      </para>
      <sect2>
        <title>Codestriker Database</title>
	<para>
	  The <varname>$db</varname> variable should be set to a DBI
	  URL representing the Codestriker database that was created,
	  as specified in <xref
	  linkend="codestriker-database-creation">.  Basically, if you
	  are using PostgreSQL, this should be:
<programlisting>
$db = 'DBI:Pg:dbname=codestrikerdb';
</programlisting>
          For MySQL, this would be:
<programlisting>
$db = 'DBI:mysql:dbname=codestrikerdb';
</programlisting>
          If your database is situated on a different host, for
          example "dbhost", this could be modified to:
<programlisting>
$db = 'DBI:mysql:dbname=codestrikerdb;host=dbhost';
</programlisting>
        The database user and password also need to be specified.  If
        your username was "codestriker", and the password was
        "cspasswd", the settings would be just:
<programlisting>
# Database user.
$dbuser = 'codestriker';

# Database password.
$dbpasswd = 'cspasswd';
</programlisting>
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Email</title>
	<para>
	  When a code review topic is created, or a comment against a
	  review is made, an email is sent out as a notification
	  mechanism.  Codestriker needs to know what mail host it can
	  use for sending email messages.  The configuration file
	  default is "localhost":
	  <programlisting>
# Location of the mailing host.  This is used when sending out codestriker
# comments.
$mailhost = 'localhost';
           </programlisting>
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Compression</title>
	<para>
	  Some of the HTML pages generated by Codestriker can be quite
	  large, depending on the review size.  If your deployment is
	  operating to users outside an intranet, it may be worth
	  enabling this option to enable compression.  Note, IE
	  doesn't support receiving compressed HTML, so setting this
	  option will have no effect.  Initially, it is best to leave
	  this option turned off (the default), and only to enable it
	  if there is a significant performance problem.
	  <programlisting>
# Indicate whether to try and compress output if the client browser
# supports it.  This can make a tremendous difference in bandwidth,
# especially over slow links.
$use_compression = 0;
	  </programlisting>
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Source Code Management Systems</title>
	<para>
	  This part of the configuration deals with informing
	  Codestriker what source code control systems you use.  By
	  doing this, Codestriker can then display reviews with
	  revision information, and then allow the reviewer to view
	  the entire contents of a file before a change, and with a
	  change applied.  When a review is created, the user
	  specifies which source control system it is applied against
	  (there may not be any, if it is just a simple patch or text
	  file).  For many Codestriker deployments, there may only be
	  a single SCM system.  The configuration file has the
	  following default value which needs to be changed:
	  <programlisting>
@valid_repositories =
    (
     '/home/sits/cvs',
     'http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi /cvsroot',
     'svn:http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk',
     ':pserver:anonymous:password@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot'
    );
	  </programlisting>
	  This is Perl syntax for a list of string values.  The first
	  value indicates a CVS repository on the same machine as
	  Codestriker, which has a CVSROOT of
	  <filename>/home/sits/cvs</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you have ViewCVS installed on your site, Codestriker can
	  use it directly for CVS information, if CVS is not installed
	  on the same machine.  The second value
	  <filename>http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi /cvsroot</filename>
	  contain the base URL for accessing ViewCVS, and the second
	  part contains the CVSROOT value of this repository, which is
	  <filename>/cvsroot</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Codestriker can also work with other source control systems.
	  There is currently support for Subversion (<ulink
	  url="http://subversion.tigris.org">http://subversion.tigris.org</ulink>),
	  and in the future, VSS, ClearCase, and any other SCM system
	  depending on demand and contributions.  The third string
	  <filename>svn:http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk</filename>
	  is a Subversion repository URL prefixed by "svn:".
	</para>
	<para>
	  The last value which is likely to be common for many
	  deployments is an anonymous CVS pserver specification.  The
	  string is actually in the same form as a CVS pserver URL.
	  For more information of setting up anonymous pserver access,
	  please consult the CVS manual.
	</para>
	<para>
	  During a review, it is sometimes beneficial to see the
	  revision history of a file, such as information provided by
	  CVSweb or ViewCVS.  You can specify a mapping of repository
	  names to URLs for this purpose, for example:
	  <programlisting>
$file_viewer =
{
    '/home/sits/cvs' => 'http://localhost/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi'
};
	  </programlisting>
	  This indicates that for any review made against the
	  <filename>/home/sits/cvs</filename> repository, file
	  revision information can be found using the URL specified.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Finally, if you are using CVS, please make sure the
	  <varname>$cvs</varname> setting is set to the correct path.
	  For *NIX, this is likely to be something like:
	  <programlisting>
# Location of the cvs binary.
$cvs = '/usr/bin/cvs';
	  </programlisting>
	  For Windows, this could be something like:
	  <programlisting>
# Location of the cvs binary.
$cvs = 'c:/gnu/bin/cvs';
	  </programlisting>
	  <emphasis>Note the use of '/' (forwrd-slash) characters,
	  rather than '\' (back-slash).  Even under Windows, when
	  setting filenames, you should always use forward
	  slashes.</emphasis>
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Bug-Tracking Integration</title>
	<para>
	  It is often useful to link the creation of code review
	  topics with the associated bug records that the code is
	  fixing.  That way, it is possible to read a bug record, and
	  apart from reading the textual description as to how it has
	  been resolved, Codestriker can add in a link to the code
	  review topic, which shows the actual code which fixed the
	  bug (and any important decisions made in the Codestriker
	  comments).  Currently, there is only support for Bugzilla,
	  but it is not difficult to add in support for other systems.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you don't use Bugzilla (<ulink
	  url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org</ulink>),
	  you can skip this section, as by default, there is no
	  linking to a bug tracking system.  An example configuration
	  could be as follows:
	  <programlisting>
# Bug tracking type.
$bug_db = 'bugzilla';

# Bug database connection details.
$bug_db_host = 'localhost';
$bug_db_name = 'bugs';
$bug_db_password = 'bugs_password';
$bug_db_dbname = 'bugs';

# Bugzilla codestriker user id.
$bug_db_user_id = '2';
	  </programlisting>
	  The <varname>$bug_db</varname> setting indicates to use
	  Bugzilla.  If this value is set to '', then no linkage to a
	  bug tracking system is performed (the default).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The <varname>$bug_db_host</varname> setting indicates the
	  hostname that holds the bugzilla database, while
	  <varname>$bug_db_name</varname> and
	  <varname>$bug_db_password</varname> contain the database
	  username and password to connect to the Bugzilla database.
	  The <varname>$bug_db_dbname</varname> setting contains the
	  Bugzilla database name, which by default is "bugs".  You can
	  verify these settings by using
	  <command>mysql</command> to connect to the Bugzilla
	  database interactively.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Codestriker adds "comments" to the appropriate bug record
	  whenever a code review topic has been created against it, or
	  the review's state has changed.  To do this, a special
	  Bugzilla user needs to be created which the comments will be
	  created against.  Create the user using the Bugzilla
	  interface, and call it "codestriker@yourhost.yourdomain".
	  Then connect to the Bugzilla database using
	  <command>mysql</command>, and execute the following command
	  to determine the userid of the user just created:
	  <programlisting>
SELECT userid FROM profiles WHERE
login_name = 'codestriker@yourhost.yourdomain';
	  </programlisting>
	  This value should be set into the
	  <varname>$bug_db_user_id</varname> setting.
	  <programlisting>
# Bugzilla codestriker user id.
$bug_db_user_id = '2';
	  </programlisting>
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>LXR Integration</title>
	<para>
	  Codestriker has been integrated with LXR, so that when
	  performing a review, those identifiers known to LXR will be
	  automatically hyperlinked.  This is an enormous aid to the
	  code reviewing process, as you can quickly determine where a
	  variable/function/method/class is defined and where it is
	  used quickly, while studying the proposed changes.
	</para>
  
        <para>
	  The LXR home page is located at <ulink
	  url="http://lxr.sourceforge.net">http://lxr.sourceforge.net</ulink>.
	  The integration has been tested with LXR version 0.9.2.
	</para>

        <para>
	  Its possible that each source code repository is associated
	  with a different LXR deployment.  The default configuration
	  file shows an example:
	  <programlisting>
$lxr_map = 
{
    '/home/sits/cvs' => { db => 'DBI:Pg:dbname=lxr',
			  user => 'lxr',
			  password => '',
			  url => 'http://localhost.localdomain/lxr/ident?i='
			},

     'svn:http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk' =>
                        { db => 'DBI:Pg:dbname=lxr2',
			  user => 'lxr',
			  password => '',
			  url => 'http://localhost.localdomain/lxr2/ident?i='
			}
			  
};
	  </programlisting>
	  This is basically fancy Perl syntax for a map.  In this
	  instance, there are two keys,
	  <filename>/home/sits/cvs</filename> and
	  <filename>'svn:http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk</filename>,
	  which represent the source control repositories specified
	  above within the <varname>@valid_repositories</varname>
	  setting.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Each key is mapped to an object containing four attributes.
	  The <varname>db</varname> attribute is a DBI URL of the LXR
	  database, <varname>user</varname> is the database username,
	  <varname>password</varname> is the database password, and
	  <varname>url</varname> is the URL of the LXR deployment for
	  the identifier search page.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you don't have LXR installed, you can simply set this
	  variable as follows:
	  <programlisting>
$lxr_map = 
{
};
	  </programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Also note, LXR at present doesn't seem to work with Taint
	  checking.  To avoid warning messages, you'll need to comment
	  out the "PerlTaintCheck On" line in your Apache
	  <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file, and remove the -T
	  switch at the top of the
	  <filename>bin/codestriker.pl.base</filename> file.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Deployment Options</title>
	<para>
	  There are a number of other options which affect how
	  Codestriker runs.  The four most important are shown below.
	  Unless you have specific reasons to, most intranet
	  deployments of Codestriker can leave these options as is.
	  <programlisting>
# Indicate if topics can be deleted.  Turning this to false can be useful for
# "anonymous" installations of codestriker.
$allow_delete = 1;

# The number of problems found per line drops if the size of the

# attempt to review too much material and then miss problems. 
# These two options allow the Codestriker administrator to limit 
# the length of the topics. Topics that have more lines than 
# $maximum_topic_size_lines are rejected when they are created. 
# Topics that are larger than $suggested_topic_size_lines generate 
# a warning displayed in the topic page, but are accepted into the 
# system. Codestriker measures that length of the topic by counting 
# the number of lines in the topic text.
#
# The codestriker default of not enforcing any limits is specified by
# settings either option to an empty string. If you are not sure 
# what a resonable limit would be, start with a suggested_topic_size_lines
# set to 350, and adjust with experence.

        for Windows, which is the Perl Package Manager.  Installing
        new Perl modules is easy.  To install the DBI module, simply
        type in the following at the <command>ppm</command> prompt.
<programlisting>

LWP::UserAgent
CGI
CGI::Carp
Net::SMTP
DBI
IPC::Run
Template
HTML::Entities
File::Temp
</programlisting>
      You'll also require <filename>DBD::Pg</filename> for PostgreSQL

        This section deals with deploying Codestriker on a webserver.
        Codestriker can run as an ordinary CGI script, which allows it

	  for each HTTP request.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Using <command>mod_perl</command>, a pool of Perl

      <para>
        The goal of this chapter is to present how to create/manage
        Codestriker projects, how to create code review topics, and
        then how to review these topics.  Assuming Codestriker has
        been configured and is running, you can get started by going
        to the following URL:
        http://yourhost.yourdomain/codestriker/codestriker.pl.  This
        should take you to the topic list screen, which is talked
        about in the following section.  From a fresh install, there
        will obviously be no code review topics in the list.  However
        there are some links at the top of the page, to "List
        projects", which will allow you to create some new projects to
        match your development process.  Once you have defined all of
        your initial projects, you can create a new code review topic
        by clicking on "Create new topic".  These screens are covered
        in the following sections.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="topic-list">
      <title>Topic List Screen</title>
      <para>
        The topic list screen is used for displaying a list of code
        review topics, which contain the topic's title, author,
        reviewers, cc, creation date, links to the bugs it fixes, and
        its state.  The email address for the author, reviewers and cc
        fields are shortened for brevity reasons.  The links from the
        bug ids will take you to the bug tracking system (currently,
        only Bugzilla is supported) for more information on that
        specific bug.  A topic can be in one of the following states:
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Open</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This is the initial state of the topic, and indicates
	        it is still open for reviewing.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Closed</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        Closed indicates that the review is no longer
	        relevant, or invalid.  A reviewer might decide that a
	        review posted is fixing a problem in the wrong way,
	        and after adding a comment, closes the review off.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Committed</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        Committed indicates that all the comments posted to
	        the review have been addressed, and that the source
	        code has been committed into the SCM system.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

        To view a specific topic, click on its title.  This will take

        possible to change the state of many topics in one action, by
        selected the checkboxes next to the topics of interest, and
        pressing the "Update" button with the state dropdown selected
        to the desired state.  If topic deletion functionality has
        been enabled, topics can be deleted by clicking on the
        individual topic, and then deleting it.  Generally speaking,
        topics are only deleted if the wrong content was posted by
        mistake.  It is useful to maintain all historical topics in
        the Codestriker database, as they can be searched over in the
        future, which is covered in <xref linkend="topic-search">.

      <title>Creating a new Project</title>
      <para>
        When a new code review topic is created, it is necessary to
        specify what project the review is related to.  Projects can
        be used as a filtering mechanism when displaying lists of
        topics (see <xref linkend="topic-search">).  This can be a
        great benefit, in the situation where a single Codestriker
        deployment is serving a large number of developer groups.
        Typically, a member of a developer group only wants to see the
        list of open code review topics in their project.

      <title>Creating a new Topic</title>
      <para>
        The "Create topic" screen can be accessed from a number of
        other screens, and requires the submission of a number of
        details in order to create a topic.  A screenshot can be seen
        in <xref linkend="figure-create-topic">.  It is also possible
        to generate new topics from the command line.  Check out the
        <filename>SubmitCodeReview.pl</filename> script in the
        <filename>bin</filename> directory in the Codestriker
        distribution.

        The topic title is a mandatory field which contains a one-line
        summary of the topic.  This title is used when the topic is
        displayed in the "Topic list" screen (see <xref
        linkend="topic-list">).  The topic description contains a more
        detailed description of the review itself, and should be enough
        for a reviewer to understand the purpose of the review.  If
        Codestriker is linked to a bug tracking system, further down in
        the form, the "Bug IDs" field gives the opportunity to enter
        in multiple bug ids (either space or comma separated), which
        will also give the reviewer an opportunity to see what bugs
        this review fixes.
      </para>
      <para>
        The "Project" dropdown list should be selected onto the
        project this review belongs to.  The last three fields contain
        comma-separated email addresses.  The "Your email address"
        field contains the email address which will receive review
        comments.  This is typically, the author's email address.  The
        "Reviewers" field contains the list of reviewer email address
        which will be notified once the review is created.  The "Cc"
        field is typically used for notifying a group email list that
        a new review has been created.  These field values are stored
        into your browser's cookie, so that the next time a review is
        created, these fields will be pre-filled, as they don't
        typically change much between different reviews.
      </para>
      <para>
        The most complex part of this form are the values required for
        the "Topic text upload", "Start tag", "End tag", "Module" and
        "Repository" fields.  These fields dictate what the actual
        review text is.  The first step is to select what source
        control management system the review was made against, and
        updating the "Repository" field accordingly.  The following
        sub-sections detail the different review inputs that can be
        handled.  Once all the details have been entered, and the
        "Submit" button is pressed, a confirmation screen will come up
        indicating that the review has been created.  An email, with
        a URL to view the topic will be sent to the author, reviewers
        and any email addresses entered in the "Cc" field.

	<title>Creating CVS Diff Topics</title>
	<para>
	  For CVS projects, a common situation is you have a checkout
	  of your project's module, and you have fixed a bug which
	  needs to be reviewed.  To get this reviewed in Codestriker,
	  you need to generate the review text, by going to the
	  top-level directory of your checkout, and issuing a command
	  like:
	  <programlisting>
% cvs diff -uN > /tmp/review.txt
	  </programlisting>
	  This command creates a diff file, which consists of the code
          changes you have made since you checked out the project from
          CVS.  The <option>-u</option> option indicates to create a
          "unidiff" formatted file, which is what Codestriker can
          parse.  The <option>-N</option> option means to show added
          and removed files.  Depending on your development process,
          you may want to issue different cvs diff commands with
          different flags, or even using "cvs rdiff" instead.
          Codestriker can accept any input, as long as
          <option>-u</option> is specified, to ensure the diff is in
          unidiff format.  Note for reviews which include C/C++ code,
          you can also include the
          <option>--show-function-line</option> and/or
          <option>--show-c-function</option> options, which will
          indicate for each diff delta in the display, what function
          is being modified.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This filename can either be entered directly into the "Topic
	  text upload" field, or selected from a file dialog which is
	  created when the "Browse" button is pressed.  The "Start
	  tag", "End tag" and "Module" fields can be left blank.  Once
	  all the other fields have been entered, clicking the
	  "Submit" button will create the review, and show a
	  confirmation screen.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In some development processes, CVS tags are used to mark
	  units of work that have been applied to the repository.
	  Rather than generating the review text via a CVS command, as
	  specified in the previously, the review text can be
	  specified by entering in the "Start tag", "End tag" and
	  "Module" name into their respective fields.  Codestriker
	  will then fetch the review text from the nominated
	  repository automatically, by executing the appropriate CVS
	  command itself.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>Creating Diff Topics</title>
	<para>
	  In some deployments, there may not even be a source control
	  management system, and it might be the case that only diffs
	  are reviewed.  An example command to generate the review
	  text could be something like:
	  <programlisting>
% diff -urN ../old-version/ . > /tmp/review.txt
	  </programlisting>
          Like the CVS command shown above, the <option>-u</option>
          and <option>-N</option> options are specified to output a
          unidiff file, which contains new and old files.  The
          <option>-r</option> option indicates to recursively check
          the source and target directories specified (in this case
          <filename>../old-version</filename> and
          <filename>.</filename> to find differences.  There are
          likely to be other options that will be specified, run
          <command>man diff</command> for more options.  Note for
          reviews which include C/C++ code, you can also include the
          <option>--show-function-line</option> and/or
          <option>--show-c-function</option> options, which will
          indicate for each diff delta in the display, what function
          is being modified.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The "Start tag", "End tag" and "Module" fields have no
	  relevance in this situation.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Creating Plain Text Topics</title>
	<para>
	  It is also possible to use Codestriker to simply review text
	  that is not in the form as a diff.  In this situation,
	  Codestriker will simply treat the text as a single new file.
	  Reviewers will still be able to view the text and make
	  comments on a per-line basis as before.  Simply put the
	  filename to be reviewed in the "Topic text upload" field.
	  The "Start tag", "End tag" and "Module" fields have no
	  relevance in this situation.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Creating Subversion Diff Topics</title>
	<para>
	  Similar to CVS, Subversion diffs are created by again, going
	  to the top of your project directory, and issuing the
	  following command:
	  <programlisting>
% svn diff -N > /tmp/review.txt
	  </programlisting>
	  This file should then be selected for the "Topic text
	  upload" field.  The "Start tag", "End tag" and "Module"
	  fields have no relevance in this situation.

	  back to the table of contents.
	</para>
	<para>
	  From this point, the screen in split into two sections,
	  where the left side represents the old version of the file,
	  and right side represents the new version.  In the figure,
	  the code in the block of red represents code which has been
	  removed in the proposed change.  Adjacent yellow blocks
	  represent code changes, as can be seen with the version
	  number change.  The green block represents new code which
	  has been added, in this instance, the new constants for
	  viewing modes.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Each file is broken up into a series of "deltas".  At the
	  head of each delta block, for both the old and new versions
	  of the file, there is an indication of what line number the
	  delta started at.  In this situation, clicking on the "Line
	  24" link on the left hand side, will open a new browser
	  window, which will contain the complete original contents of
	  <filename>codestriker/codestriker.pl</filename>, anchored at
	  line 24.  Clicking on the "Line 22" link on the right hand
	  side will contain the complete contents of

	  browser window will come up with the "Add Comment" page (see
	  <xref linkend="add-comment">).  This may take some time the
	  first time, as a new browser window needs to be created.
	  After the comment has been entered, the main browser window
	  is displayed, and the comment window is not closed, so that
	  for subsequent comments, the add comment window can be

        For each line, all of the comments made are shown, including
        the author and date information.  Each comment block has a
        state associated with it, which is primarily for the author's
        benefit to change.  The following states are defined:
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Submitted</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This is the initial state that a comment block will have.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Invalid</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This can be set to indicate that the comments made in
	        this block are actually not valid.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Completed</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This is typically set by the author, as a record, to
	        indicate that the comments in this block have been
	        subsequently addressed in their code.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
	For each comment block, there are three links to other
	Codestriker screens.  The first link will bring up a "View
	File" page (see <xref linkend="view-file">) centered on the
	line number of the comment, "Parallel" will do the same, by
	using the parallel view, and the "Add comment" link will bring
	up the "Add Comment" page (see <xref linkend="add-comment">)
	for that line number.
      </para>
      <para>
        In this particular example, there are two comment blocks, for
        file <filename>codestriker/codestriker.pl</filename>, on lines
        27 and 60.
      </para>
      <para>
        At the top of this page are a number of filtering options,
        which control what comments are displayed.  Comments can be
        filtered by the author of the comment and/or by comment block
        state.  In addition, for each comment block, it is also
        possible to display the context of the topic text the comment
        block is made against (as is done for the "Add Comment" page,
        see
        <xref linkend="add-comment">).  These controls provide the
        capability for generating code review reports, which can then
        be used at code inspection meetings.

      <title>Topic Search</title>
      <para>
        If Codestriker is used to review all new code before it is
        committed into a SCM, it builds up a very important
        development history.  Since all this information is stored in
        a relational database, the information is searchable.  The
        "Topic Search" screen provides an interface for locating
        topics, depending on a search criteria.  The "Topic Search"
        screen can be seen in <xref linkend="topic-search">.
        <figure id="figure-search" float="1">
	   <title>Topic Search Screenshot</title>

	</figure>
      </para>
      <para>
        By default, pressing "Submit" without typing anything extra
        will return all open topics in the system.  This is because
        the "State" field is set to match any topic in state "Open",
        and the "Project" field is set to "Any", which will match any
        project, and there are no other constraints in the other
        fields.  The search can be narrowed by entering in matching
        text in the "Author", "Reviewer", "Cc" and "Bug ID" fields.
      </para>
      <para>
        The "Contains text" field in allows for searching in the
        following areas, depending on which checkboxes have been
        enabled (multiple checkboxes are ORed together):
	  <variablelist>
	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>title</term>
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  This will try to match the entered text with a
		  topic's title.
	        </para>
	      </listitem>
	    </varlistentry>

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>description</term>
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  This will try to match the entered text with a
		  topic's description.
	        </para>
	      </listitem>
	    </varlistentry>

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>comment</term>
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  This will try to match the entered text with a
		  comment associated with a topic.
	        </para>
	      </listitem>
	    </varlistentry>

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>body</term>
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  This will try to match the entered text with the
		  actual code associated with a topic.
	        </para>
	      </listitem>
	    </varlistentry>

	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>filename</term>
	      <listitem>
	        <para>
		  This will try to match the entered text with a
		  filename that was a part of a topic.
	        </para>
	      </listitem>
	    </varlistentry>
	  </variablelist>
      </para>
      <para>
        In all cases, text entered will match the corresponding
        database text fields as a substring match.  That is, entering
        "paul" in the "Author" field will match the author
        "paul@zot.com" or "joe_paul@zoo.com".  It is also possible to
        use wildcards in the entered text, such as "joe*paul@zoo.com".
	Once the "Submit" button is pressed, the results are displayed
        in the "Topic List" page (see <xref linkend="topic-list">).

    <sect1>
      <title>Codestriker Layout</title>
      <para>
        This chapter is for developers which wish to contribute to
	Codestriker, and want a quick birds-eye view as to how the
	code is structured.  The codestriker modules are broken into
	the following sub-modules, which are located in
	<filename>lib/Codestriker</filename>:
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Action</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        Every action or gesture that can be performed on the
		Codestriker UI has an associated module for handling
		that action.  The name of the module indicates what
		action it is handling.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>BugDB</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        Support for updating bug tracking systems when topics
		are created or their state is changed against specific
		bug reports.  Currently, only Bugzilla is supported,
		but the API can support other bug-tracking systems.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>DB</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        A thin wrapper over the DBI interface, to
		create/remove database connections.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>FileParser</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        These modules are responsible for parsing the input
		text when topics are created.  Currently, CVS
		unidiffs, PATCH unidiffs and Subversion diff files are
		supported.  The API for these parsers is simply to
		accept input text, and to return an array of delta
		objects, which describe source code changes made to a
		specific file on specific lines.  These delta objects
		are then used for rendering a topic, so that they are
		agnostic to which source control system they
		originated from.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Http</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This contains initial HTTP request processing, and
		support for generating an HTTP response, including the
		handling of cookies and compressed streams.  This
		sub-module also contains the all-important Render.pm
		module, which is the work-horse for generating the
		complex HTML from the topic deltas.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Model</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This contains the persistent objects of the system,
		and the associated database operations on them.  These
		objects include Topics, Comments, Files and Deltas.
		The Action classes eventually call these model objects
		when the persistent state of the system needs to be
		queried or modified.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Repository</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        A number of objects implement the Repository API,
		which is used throughout the system.  Repositories
		currently supported include a local CVS repository, a
		remote CVS repository whose data is accessed by HTTP
		or the pserver protocol, and Subversion.  Future
		repositories can be easily added to this framework.
		The methods in the repository API include a way of
		retrieving the entire contents of a specified file and
		revision (which is used in the ViewFile action
		module), and the generation of a revision file log
		URL.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Smtp</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        A simple API for sending email messages.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
      </para>

      <para>
	In addition to the above modules, the following directories
	are of interest:
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>bin</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This contains the all-important
		<filename>checksetup.pl</filename> script, which is
		used for initialising the system, and for performing
		upgrades.  This isn't the most pretty script in the
		world, partly for all of the old data-migration it has
		to do from old versions to the current version.  This
		directory also contains
		<filename>SubmitCodeReview.pl</filename> which is a
		way of generating code reviews from the command line.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>cgi-bin</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This contains the codestriker.pl CGI script.  It reads
		the "action" parameter from the URL, and delegates the
		handling of the request to the appropriate action
		object.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>html</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This contains the <filename>codestriker.css</filename>
	        file.

	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>templates</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        Almost all of the HTML generated by codestriker (apart
	        from the actual code rendering) can be customised by
	        the templates within this directory.  Each Action
	        object typically has an associated template, where the
	        view can be easily customized.  There is also a header
	        and footer template, which is included in every page,
	        for site customization.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>doc</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This directory contains the source for the Codestriker
	        guide written in docbook, contained in the
	        <filename>codestriker.sgml</filename>, with the
	        <filename>Makefile</filename> for building the various

      <title>Database Schema</title>
      <para>
        The <filename>bin/checksetup.pl</filename> script contains the
        <command>CREATE TABLE</command> statements that are used when
        the Codestriker database is initialised, in the
        <varname>$table</varname> hash.  The following tables are
        defined:
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>project</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        A Codestriker database can consist of a number of
	        projects, which have a name, id, description and
	        creation date.  Each code review topic, is linked to a
	        specific project.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>topic</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        A topic represents a code review that has been
	        submitted to Codestriker.  It contains attributes like
	        the author, title, description, creation date,
	        repository, and is linked to a member project.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <term>participant</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        A participant is associated with a topic, and contains
	        an email address, and the type of participant they
	        are, such as the author, reviewer or observer
	        (somebody was is CC'ed for the review).

	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>comment</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	         A comment is made against a specific review, and
	         consists of the author and the comment text itself.
	         It is linked with a specific commentstate object.

	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>commentstate</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        A commentstate row represents a comment block - a list
