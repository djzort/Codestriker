Version 1.4:

* Clicking on an original diff block line heading will open a popup
  window displaying colour-coded contents of the original file.
  Clicking on a new diff block line heading will open a popup window
  displaying colour-coded contents of the new file.  In each case, it
  is possible to click on topic lines to enter comments, which are
  done in the main browser window.

  a CVS viewing system, such as cvs web.

  form.  This is displayed in the view topic screen, with a link to

  description of the form "[Bb][Uu][Gg]\s*\d+" is also rendered to the
  appropriate bug tracking page.

* Comment emails sent now include the filename and line number
  (where possible) that the comment was made against.

  fast nagivation, and indicates what files are present in the review.

Version 1.2:

* Converted to use CSS to reduce the resulting HTML size and to enable
  easier customisation.

* Coloured diff mode handles ordinary patches, CVS diffs, and ordinary
  text.

* Put in more newlines to make the resulting HTML more readable.
