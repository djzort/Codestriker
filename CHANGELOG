Version 1.5.2:

* Fixed minor rendering bug in view single file mode.

* Added Message-Id, In-Reply-To and References headers, so emails
  relating to the same topic will be displayed in the same thread, for
  those email clients which supported threaded views.

Version 1.5.1:

* Fixed bug where viewing a file in a popup didn't work for those diffs
  which contained empty lines.

Version 1.5.0:

* Just some documentation changes.  No code changes from 1.5.0b3.

Version 1.5.0b3:

* Comments are now entered via a popup window.  This means the
  relatively heavy operation of loading the view topic screen can be
  done just once initially, and many comments can be submitted, rather
  than reloading the view screen after each comment submission.

Version 1.5.0b2:

* Fixed minor rendering bug in the coloured view mode.

Version 1.5.0b1:

* Broke up the system into a number of Perl modules to make future
  work far easier to accomplish.

* Now uses a database for storing Codestriker's data.  This simplifies
  serching and updating of the data, compared to the previous
  filesystem persistance.

* There is now a topic search screen, which displays its results in a
  simple topic list screen.  From here, individual topics can be
  selected for display.

* Topic now has a simple notion of state.  When a topic is created, it
  is in state "Open".  When a review has been done and the code has
  been committed, the author changes the state to "Committed".  If the
  review is not to be committed, but needs to be resubmitted, the
  author moves the topic to state "Closed".  These states are useful
  when displaying lists of topics in the system, to see what is
  currently pending.

* A migration tool is available to automatically transfer <= 1.4.X
  codestriker data into the database.

Version 1.4.5:

* Fixed minor rendering bug with line numbers.

* Fixed minor bug where adding a CC to a comment with more than one
  person on that line failed.

* Support for the handling of binary files in diffs.

* Fix bug in popup parallel coloured-diff mode where the anchor names
  weren't being generated properly, resulting in some browsers not
  centering their view in the correct place.

* Fixed bug in pop parallel coloured-diff mode where changes right at
  the end of the file weren't rendered.

* Support for parsing files generated with cvs diff -b.

Version 1.4.4:

* Made the CVS file data retrieve command expanded within an eval for
  flexibility.  Included example using the curl command in
  codestriker.conf.

* Can now view coloured diff mode either in monospace font (requires
  more real-estate) or in variable-width font (harder to read code).
  The choice can be made dynamically. [Note the monospaced diff mode
  can be set for $default_topic_create_mode in codestriker.conf]

* Added a <BASE> tag which reduces the HTML size.  Also used cookies
  more intelligently so that the dreaded edit topic and other URLs
  were cut down to size, which also helped reducing the output.

* Took the gzip compression code from CVSweb and plonked it in.  Works
  nicely with Mozilla/Netscape/Konqueror.  If the Compress::Zlib
  library is installed, that is used for compression, otherwise the
  "gzip" executable is used (although this isn't an option if you are
  running this script within mod_perl).  [Note there are two new
  options in codestriker.conf - $use_compression and $gzip]

* Codestriker now works under mod_perl successfully.  Updated
  installation instructions for use under mod_perl.

Version 1.4.3:

* New popup viewing mode "parallel".  In addition to being able to
  bring up a new window containing the contents of a file in its
  original or new form, you can also set the popup display to be a
  coloured diff, containing the contents of the original and the new
  file side by side (similar to the main screen in coloured diff
  mode).  While this mode is more bandwidth intensive, this can also
  aid considerably in the reviewing process.

* Tab width can now be changed dynamically between 4 and 8 to handle
  varying review inputs.  Tab expanision is also handled more
  consistently.

* Support for "diff -uNp", "diff -uN --show-function-line=regexp",
  "cvs diff -uNp" and "cvs diff -uN  --show-function-line=regexp".

* URLs entered in the description or in a comment will be rendered as
  a link to that URL.

* Allow the bug field to accept multiple bug IDs.

* Introduced codestriker.conf, which isolates a site's configuration
  into a single file.  This simplifies upgrading.

Version 1.4.2:

* Can now handle diffs which end in: "\ No newline at end of file".

* Changed the HTML generation for popup windows displaying old/new
  versions of a file to use <PRE> rather than a table, which cuts down
  the loading time considerably.  Note, the codestriker.css file had
  to be changed.

Version 1.4.1:

* Popup windows were not resizable in IE due to a bug in the
  javascript code.  Has now been fixed.

Version 1.4:

* Clicking on an original diff block line heading will open a popup
  window displaying colour-coded contents of the original file.
  Clicking on a new diff block line heading will open a popup window
  displaying colour-coded contents of the new file.  In each case, it
  is possible to click on topic lines to enter comments, which are
  done in the main browser window.

* The file names for each file block is now optionally hyperlinked to
  a CVS viewing system, such as cvs web.

* An optional bug number field is now a part of the topic creation
  form.  This is displayed in the view topic screen, with a link to
  the appropriate bug tracking (eg bugzilla) page.  Text within the
  description of the form "[Bb][Uu][Gg]\s*\d+" is also rendered to the
  appropriate bug tracking page.

* Comment emails sent now include the filename and line number
  (where possible) that the comment was made against.

* Creation date for a topic is shown in the view topic screen.

* Can download topic text as "text/plain" from view topic screen.

Version 1.3: 

* Included table of contents for coloured diff mode, which allows for
  fast nagivation, and indicates what files are present in the review.

* Added better handling of patch files.

Version 1.2:

* Converted to use CSS to reduce the resulting HTML size and to enable
  easier customisation.

* Coloured diff mode handles ordinary patches, CVS diffs, and ordinary
  text.

* Put in more newlines to make the resulting HTML more readable.

* Removed a stray <PRE> tag in coloured diff mode.
