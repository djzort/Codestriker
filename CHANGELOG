Version 1.3: 

* Included table of contents for coloured diff mode, which allows for
  fast nagivation, and indicates what files are present in the review.

* Added better handling of patch files.

Version 1.2:

* Converted to use CSS to reduce the resulting HTML size and to enable
  easier customisation.

* Coloured diff mode handles ordinary patches, CVS diffs, and ordinary
  text.

* Put in more newlines to make the resulting HTML more readable.

* Removed a stray <PRE> tag in coloured diff mode.
