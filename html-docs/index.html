	<p>
	    Codestriker is a perl CGI script which is used for
	    performing code reviews in a collaborative fashion as
	    opposed to sending patches and comments using unstructured
	    emails.  
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    An example Codestriker topic can be seen from
	    <A
 	    HREF="http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/codestriker.pl?topic=859818&action=view">here</A>.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    You can also create your own topic, by going to the
	    following URL: <A
	    HREF="http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/codestriker.pl?action=create">http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/codestriker.pl?action=create</A>.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    Each topic is given a random unique id, and the
	    search/list topics functionality in this deployment is
	    disabled, to support public use and to give some form of
	    anonymity.  Unfortunately, the ability to view a file
	    before and/or after a proposed change is not enabled,
	    since HTTP connections to remote CVS repositories can't be
	    established due to firewall settings on the SourceForge
	    servers.  The file viewing functionality is described in
	    more detail below.

	    <p>	  
	    Bear this in mind, but in any case, go ahead and give it a go!

	    <p>
	    Feedback is most welcome.  Contact details are at the
	    bottom of this page.

	<h2>Features</h2>
	<p>
	    Authors create code review topics, where the nominated
	    reviewers will be automatically notified by email.
	    Reviewers then submit comments against the code on a
	    per-line basis, and can also view comments submitted by
	    the other reviewers as they are created.  Emails are sent
	    to the appropriate parties when comments are created, as
	    an alert mechanism.  The author is also free to submit
	    comments against the review comments.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Once all reviewers have finished, the author has all
	    review comments available in a structured fashion, as
	    opposed to a pile of unstructured emails.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Special support is provided for integration with a CVS
	    repository, for the display of coloured diffs and for the
	    ability to view original and new files in their entirety
	    (and side-by-side) to assist in the review process.
	    Codestriker can be optionally linked with a bug tracking
	    system, such as bugzilla, and a CVS web viewing system,
	    such as CVS web to obtain further information necessary to
	    complete a review.
        </p>
	<p>
	    Special support is also provided for Bugzilla integration
	    (other bug-tracking systems are easy to support).  Apart
	    from recording which bugs a topic is fixing, Codestriker
	    can automatically update the appropriate bugs, by adding
	    comments with details of the Codestriker topic that is
	    fixing it, including the URL.  See the README file for
	    more information.
        </p>
	<p>
	    Special support is also provided for
	    <A HREF="http://lxr.sourceforge.net">LXR</A> integration.
	     Those identifiers known to LXR will be automatically
	     hyperlinked when viewing a code review.  This is an
	     enormous aid to the code reviewing process, as you can
	     quickly determine where a variable/function/method/class
	     is defined and where it is used quickly, while studying
	     the proposed changes.  See the README file for more
	     information.
        </p>
	<p>
	     The Template Toolkit is used for generating HTML output,
	     so the appearance of Codestriker can be modified without
	     changing any Perl code.
        </p> 

	<h2>Example usage</h2>
	<p>
	    This example will show how a new topic is created, how it
	    is viewed, and how new comments can be submitted.
	    <FONT COLOR="red">Warning: the screenshots below are a
	    little outdated, but the concepts haven't changed that
	    much.</FONT>  As mentioned above, you can see an existing
	    review from <A
	    HREF="http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/codestriker.pl?topic=859818&action=view">here</A>,
	    or you can create your own topic, by going to the
	    following URL: <A
	    HREF="http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/codestriker.pl?action=create">http://codestriker.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/codestriker.pl?action=create</A>.
	</p>
	<h3>Creating a new topic</h3>
	<p>
	    A new code review topic is created by filling in the form
	    in the create topic screen (click to enlarge image).
	</p>
	<p>
	    <a href="create.jpg">
	       <img src="create_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="175"
	       alt="Create review">
	    </a>
	</p>
	<p>
	    The "Topic title" field provides a summary of
	    the new topic.  The "Topic description"
	    provides a description as to what the code changes are,
	    which needs to be informative, as this is the text that
	    is sent with the topic creation email.  URLs will be
	    rendered as hyperlinks, and strings in the form of "Bug
	    <ID>" will be linked to your bug tracking system (if
	    defined), when the description is displayed on the view
	    topic screen.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The actual code itself is entered either pasted inline
	    into the "Topic text" form element, or uploaded
	    from a file.  In practical use, often the text contains
	    the output of the command "cvs diff -uN" or
	    simply "diff -ruN", which will effectively shows
	    the proposed code differences.
	</p>
        <p>
	    The "Bug" field is optional, and is used to link the
	    review to bugs present in your bug tracking system, such
	    as Bugzilla.  If bug ids are entered, links to each bug
	    will be present in the view topic screen.
        </p>
	<p>
	    The following three email address fields are stored into a
	    cookie, as they will often be used again for subsequent
	    topic creations.  The "email address" is also
	    used when submitting comments.  Once the submit button is
	    pressed, an email is sent to all of the email addresses
	    indicating that a new topic has been created, with the URL
	    indicating how to access the topic.
	</p>
	<h3>Viewing the topic</h3>
	<p>
	    When viewing a topic, the title appears at the top,
	    followed by the creation date of the topic, and a link to
	    the bug page that this topic fixes (ie, a view bug page in
	    bugzilla).  This is followed by the email addresses of the
	    people involved, and what their respective roles are.  The
	    size of the topic text is then shown, to indicate a rough
	    size of the review.  The topic state is then shown.  When
	    a topic is created, it is in state "Open".  It is the
	    author's responsibility to maintain this state.  if the
	    review is eventually committed, the state should be
	    updated to "Committed".  If the review needs to be
	    re-submitted, is should be moved to state "Closed".  These
	    states are useful when performing searches over topics, as
	    detailed further below.
        </p>
	<p>
	    Following the topic state is the topic description
	    follows.  The number of comments made against this topic
	    is then shown.  If required, the actual topic text can be
	    downloaded (ie, if it is a patch which later needs to be
	    applied).  The code text is then shown in its entirety,
	    followed by the submitted comments.  Clicking on
	    "comments" will take the browser to the start of the
	    comments at the end of the page.
	</p>
	<p>
	    A comment can be made against any line by simply clicking
	    on the line number.  Lines which are coloured red indicate
	    that comments have already been submitted against it.  By
	    moving the mouse over these red lines, a digest of the
	    comment will appear in the browser's status line.  For
	    those browsers which support it, a tooltip will also popup
	    containing the comment digest.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <a href="view.jpg">
	        <img src="view_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="188"
		     alt="View review 1"></a>
	</p>
	<p>
	    In this example, the user scrolls to the bottom of the
	    page, and clicks on line number 247 (click to enlarge
	    image), which brings up a popup window for submitting a
	    comment.
	</p>
	<h3>Submitting a comment</h3>
	<p>
	    The user then fills out the form as shown in the
	    following diagram.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <a href="edit.jpg">
	        <img src="edit_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="207"
		     alt="Edit review"></a>
	</p>
	<p>
	    A few lines are shown indicating the code of interest.
	    The line marked in red is the line the comment is being
	    made against.  Clicking on "increase" or
	    "decrease" will increase or decrease the the
	    number of surrounding lines respectively.  If cookies are
	    enabled in your browser, the email address in the form
	    will be remembered, so that you don't need to enter it in
	    for all subsequent comments.
	</p>
	<p>
	    The "comments" field is used for entered in your comments.
	    The submit button will lodge your comment, and the view
	    topic window should be bought automatically into focus
	    again, centered on the line you just made your comment
	    against, as shown in the following diagram.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <a href="view2.jpg">
	       <img src="view2_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="179"
	            alt="View review 2"></a>
	</p>

	<h3>Coloured diff support</h3>
	<p>
	   Codestriker provides special support when the topic
	   contents are in the form from the command "cvs diff -uN" or
	   "diff -ruN".  The "-p" or "--show-function-line" arguments
	   are also supported in the display.  Although not shown
	   above, the topic view screen has a link at the top, to
	   alternate between coloured diff and the textual view.  An
	   example of a coloured diff display can be seen below, which
	   some developers find easier to read than an ordinary diff.
	</p>
	<p>
	   <a href="view3.jpg">
	      <img src="view3_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="121"
	           alt="View coloured diff"></a>
	</p>
	<p>
	   At the start of a page is a "table of contents", which
	   indicates which files are a part of the review, and their
	   associated revision numbers if applicable.  Clicking on the
	   filenames will direct the browser directly to that section
	   of the review.  Each file has a header of the form "Diff
	   for &lt;filename&gt; ...".  The filename is linked to the
	   associated CVS viewing page (such as CVS web) for that
	   file.
        </p>
	<p>
	   Each diff block is titled with a line heading.  Clicking on
	   the left line heading will open a new popup window with the
	   contents of the original file, located at that line number.
	   Clicking on the right line heading will open a new popup
	   window with the contents of the new file, located at line
	   number.  This capability can assist greatly when doing
	   complicated reviews, where a diff segment doesn't provide
	   enough contextual information.  An example of a popup
	   window can be seen in the screenshot below.  Note those
	   lines in the popup which refer to the topic text will be
	   hyperlinked to the add comment page, which will be loaded
	   in the main browser.  Click on the image below to enlarge
	   it.
	</p>
        <p>
	   <a href="screenshot.jpg">
	      <img src="screenshot_thumb.jpg" width="200" height="160"
	           alt="CVS integration"></a>
	</p>

	<p>
 	   Next to the "Line" links, the latest versions of
 	   Codestriker also contain a "Parallel" link, which will
 	   bring up a new popup window that will show both the
 	   original and new file contents side-by-side, centered on
 	   the selected line number.  While this viewing mode is more
 	   bandwidth intensive, for some files, this can greatly aid
 	   in the reviewing process.  An example can be seen on the
 	   image below.  The line numbers in this window refer to line
 	   numbers.  The original file is presented on the left, the
 	   new file on the right.
        </p>	
	<p>
	    <a href="view4.jpg">
	       <img src="view4_thumb.jpg" width="150" height="94"
	            alt="View review 4"></a>
	</p>
	<h3>Topic search</h3>
	<p>
	At the top of the view topic screens, there is a "Search"
	link (not shown in the above snapshots).  This takes you to a
	simple search form, allowing you to search by "author",
	"reviewer", "cc", "bug id", "topic state" and/or text that
	appears in the topic title, description, comment and/or body.
	Submitting the query takes you to the topic list screen, which
	allows you to then drill down to individual topics.
