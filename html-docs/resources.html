	          Software Reviews are recognized to be a cost
		  effective way of finding and fixing defects in
		  software products. If you are not performing any
		  type of reviews or inspections right now, you should
		  consider reading some of the literature below.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Reviews are commonly sited as a main factor for the
		  superior quality found in mature open source
		  software projects. For example, OpenBSD credits its
		  incredible security track record with repeated
		  inspections of its source code.  Even, the extreme
		  programming movement advocates pair programming,
		  essentially a constant review during coding process.
		</p>
		<p>
		  However, many, many projects either don't do reviews
		  or do them so poorly that they are a waste of
		  money. If you interested in doing reviews on your
		  projects, and have never been trained, please pick
		  up one of the following books.

		</p>
		<p>
		  This is the best book for people who are just
		  starting out with software reviews. It is very
		  accessible description of the software review
		  process. It describes the best known processes for
		  running reviews, deals with common challenges
		  introducing reviews into a typical organization, and
		  has a section on the metric data collection and
		  analysis. If you can only get one book, this is the
		  one to get.

		</p>
		<p>
		  This book is about 10 years old. It mainly focuses
		  on the processes used by IBM.  It also has some case
		  studies from other companies. It describes a
		  hard-core formal inspection process. If you do any
		  inspections or reviews currently, this book will
		  make you feel bad for not running them better. If
		  you are responsible for making inspections happen in
		  your organization, then you will probably want to
		  pick up this book. It is very detailed in its
		  descriptions of the different steps in a full blown
		  formal inspection process, has an exhaustive list of
		  forms, and metric data that you will want to
		  consider tracking. The case study from the Sema
		  Group has some metric data that really drives home
		  the danger of inspecting too much material and
		  generally going too fast. I can only recommend this
		  book for people that have already decided to do
		  inspections, and are interested in making sure they
		  are done well. If you need to sell inspections to
		  others, stick with the "Peer Reviews In Software"
		  book.

		  The "Peer Reviews In Software" book has a companion
		  web site with templates, sample chapters from the
		  book, excel files for metrics analysis, and links to
		  some commercial reviewing tools.

		  Construx (Steve McConnell's company) has a training
		  class for doing software reviews.

		  I have not attended the class, but Steve McConnell
		  is one of the most respected people in the software
		  engineering community, so I am sure that it would be
		  worth checking out.

		  We have not used any of these tools. The small
		  number of tools that are available just underscores
		  how few projects are using them.  If people have any
		  experience with any of the tools listed and would
		  like to write us a review, please drop us a
		  note. Also, if we missed a tool, please email us a
