		  I was working in a large multi-national networking
		  company, where in my particular group, code reviews
		  were conducted over email, in a similar manner to
		  what is done on the Linux kernel mailing list.
		  People submitted proposed changes in an email to a
		  group address, nominated a particular reviewer, who
		  then sent their comments back as a reply with their
		  comments inline.
		</p>
		<p>
		  For the purposes of reviewing small changes, this
		  process seemed to work quite well.  Our group then
		  received a series of seminars in regards to
		  performing <em>effective code inspections</em>,
		  which was a highly formalised process involving
		  significant preparation time, sit-down meetings and
		  formal roles, such as author, reviewer, and
		  recorder.  This sounded highly promising, but the
		  huge amount of up-front work tended to turn people
		  off the process.  When the process was used, we
		  found a number of defects that most likely would
		  have been missed in an informal email review, and
		  would have surfaced later as a defect discovered at
		  a customer site.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Later, I joined a startup company, where a lot of
		  new code was being written.  We also used email
		  initially for the purposes of code reviewing,
		  however this had a number of limitations.  As
		  before, I found I constantly had to refer to the
		  existing source code files to understand the context
		  of the changes.  In addition, I found that once more
		  than one person was performing a review of a
		  proposed change, it became cumbersome to merge their
		  comments together.  Also, the reviewers were unaware
		  of their colleague's comments until they sent their
		  email, which could result in duplicate work.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Codestriker was born to fill this gap back in
		  December 2001, when version 1.0 was released on
		  SourceForge.  Because it was a quick-and-dirty
		  concept, I wrote a simple single-file CGI Perl
		  script, which accepted a text file which constituted
		  the review (usually the output from <em>cvs diff
		  -uN</em>), sent notification emails to the reviewers
		  indicating they had a review to do.  The reviewers
		  saw a page displaying the text file, where each line
		  had a hyperlink allowing them to add a comment to
		  it.  Any comments submitted were sent by email to
		  the author and the reviewers.  The list of comments
		  already made were also displayed at the bottom of
		  the page, and a line which already had a comment had
		  a red hyperlink.  No database was involved, data was
		  recorded using simple files.  The most important
		  thing was the process was still light-weight enough
		  that nobody was put off by a slightly more
		  structured process.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Eventually, the single-file script kept growing to
		  include the coloured display of diff files, and
		  integration with CVS so that changes could be more
		  readily understood within the context of the whole
		  file.  More and more features became available,
		  including the use of a database for persistence, and
		  Codestriker eventually became the modularised Perl
		  web application that it is today.
		</p>
		<p>
		  The last few releases of Codestriker have made it
		  acceptable for use in both light-weight review
		  processes, and for formal inspection processes.
